"The James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) is a space telescope designed primarily to conduct infrared astronomy. As the largest optical telescope in space, its high infrared resolution and sensitivity allow it to view objects too old, distant, or faint for the Hubble Space Telescope.","James Webb Space Telescope"
"JWST was launched on 25 December 2021 on an Ariane 5 rocket from Kourou, French Guiana, and arrived at the Sun–Earth L2 Lagrange point in January 2022. The telescope is named after James E. Webb, who was the administrator of NASA from 1961 to 1968 during the Mercury, Gemini, and Apollo programs.","James Webb Space Telescope"
"The telescope's primary mirror consists of 18 hexagonal gold-plated beryllium mirror segments. Its sunshield is made of five layers of a specialized heat-resistant material called Kapton, which protects the telescope from the Sun's heat and keeps it at an operating temperature of approximately −233 °C (−387.4 °F).","James Webb Space Telescope"
